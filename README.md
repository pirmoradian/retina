# Spike train analysis 

Analyzing spike trains of ganglion cells recorded from mouse retina using a high-density multi-electrode array with 4096 electrodes. These codes were partly used for analysis of our [publication](Hilgen et al. - 2017 - Scientific Reports.pdf). 

## Code description

* firingrate.ipynb: Computing firing rates of ganglion cells, including PSTH and raster plots
* sta.ipynb: analyzing spike-triggered average of ganglion cells 

## Developer

This package is developed by [Sahar Pirmoradian](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sahar_Pirmoradian). If you need help or have questions, don't hesitate to get in touch.
